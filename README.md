# Amazing Queer Speakers

A list of queer speakers who would like to speak at QueerJS events worldwide :earth_asia:

This list serves two purposes: Raise awareness of the queer speakers in the tech community and also to help the QueerJS organizers know where it would be interesting to host new meetups.

Thank you for being part of this!
